    "text": "Tutorial\nTutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set\n\nimport pandas as pd\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pic16b-ucla/24W/main/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv\"\npenguins = pd.read_csv(url)\n\nFirst let’s look at the first few rows of the dataset.\n\npenguins.head()\n\nIt appears that there are a few numeric columns in our dataframe which would be easy to analyze. Let’s specifically look at two and plot them on a scatter plot. For this example, I chose ‘Culmen Length’ and ’Flipper Length). I imported the seaborn package as it has great functions for visualization. I chose to create a scatterplot because it is the best way to analyze numeric data against numeric data.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsns.scatterplot(\n    data = penguins,\n    x = \"Culmen Length (mm)\", \n    y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that there is a positive relationship between culmen length and flipper length. Let’s go even further through analyzing if the type of species affects this relationship. To do this, we add the hue parameter. I also used the set_title function to make our plot look even better!\n\nsns.scatterplot(\n    data = penguins,\n    x = \"Culmen Length (mm)\", \n    y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\", \n    hue = \"Species\").set_title(\"Flipper Length vs Culmen Length in mm vs Species\")\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Flipper Length vs Culmen Length in mm vs Species')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, species type does seem to affect the culmen length and flipper length values. For instance, there appears to be distinct groupings based upon species type, as the Gentoo Penguin appears to have the longest dimensions with the adelie penguins and chinstrap penguins having similar flipper lengths but differing culmen lengths."
